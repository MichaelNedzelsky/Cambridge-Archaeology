# Agent-Based Simulation for Inheritance Pattern Analysis

## Overview

This document describes the agent-based model developed to test five inheritance systems against archaeological aDNA data from Roman-era Cambridgeshire sites. The model uses Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to determine the most likely inheritance patterns for each archaeological site.

## Model Architecture

### Agent-Based Framework

The simulation models individual people as agents within a population over multiple generations. Each agent has:

- **Demographics**: Sex, age, generation
- **Genetics**: Y-chromosome and mtDNA haplogroups
- **Social Status**: Inheritance status, burial location
- **Relationships**: Parent-offspring, kinship networks

### Inheritance Systems Tested

1. **Strongly Patrilineal** (90% male inheritance)
   - Theoretical prediction: Y-diversity = 0, high mtDNA diversity
   - Expected kinship: Many father-son pairs, few female-female relationships

2. **Weakly Patrilineal** (70% male inheritance)
   - Mixed pattern with patrilineal bias

3. **Balanced** (50% male/female inheritance)
   - Equal inheritance opportunities regardless of sex

4. **Weakly Matrilineal** (70% female inheritance)
   - Mixed pattern with matrilineal bias

5. **Strongly Matrilineal** (90% female inheritance)
   - Theoretical prediction: Y-diversity = 1, low mtDNA diversity
   - Expected kinship: Many mother-daughter pairs, few male-male relationships

## Implementation Details

### Simulation Parameters

```python
class SimulationParameters:
    inheritance_system: str                    # One of 5 systems above
    generations: int = 4                       # Cemetery timespan
    population_per_generation: int = 20        # Base population size
    burial_probability: float = 0.8            # Chance of burial at site
    adna_success_rate: float = 0.7            # DNA extraction success
    migration_rate: float = 0.1                # External gene flow
    starting_haplogroups_y: List[str]          # Founder Y-chromosomes
    starting_haplogroups_mt: List[str]         # Founder mtDNA

### Key Statistics Calculated

#### Haplotype Diversity (Nei's Formula)
```
H = (n/(n-1)) * (1 - Σp²)
```
Where n = sample size, p = frequency of each haplogroup

#### Kinship Relationship Ratios
- Father-son pairs / total relationships
- Mother-daughter pairs / total relationships
- Same-sex vs cross-sex kinship patterns
- Male vs female kinship frequency

#### Population Structure Metrics
- Sex ratios in burials
- Inheritance patterns by sex
- Haplogroup sharing within sites

## ABC Model Selection Framework

### What is ABC Rejection Sampling?

ABC (Approximate Bayesian Computation) is a **likelihood-free** Bayesian method used when the likelihood function is intractable or too complex to compute directly. Instead of calculating exact probabilities, it uses **simulation-based inference**.

### Core ABC Algorithm

```python
# Step 1: Generate many simulations for each inheritance system
for system in ['strongly_patrilineal', 'weakly_patrilineal', 'balanced',
               'weakly_matrilineal', 'strongly_matrilineal']:
    for i in range(100):  # 100 simulations per system
        simulation_result = run_simulation(system)
        sim_statistics = calculate_summary_statistics(simulation_result)

        # Step 2: Calculate distance from observed data
        distance = calculate_distance(sim_statistics, observed_statistics)

        # Store results
        distances.append(distance)
        systems.append(system)
```

### Distance Calculation

The model compares simulated statistics to observed archaeological data using **weighted Euclidean distance**:

```python
def calculate_distance(sim_stats, obs_stats, weights):
    distance = 0.0
    total_weight = 0.0
    for key, weight in weights.items():
        if key in both datasets:
            # Normalize by observed value to handle different scales
            if obs_stats[key] != 0:
                normalized_diff = abs(sim_stats[key] - obs_stats[key]) / abs(obs_stats[key])
            else:
                normalized_diff = abs(sim_stats[key])
            distance += weight * normalized_diff
            total_weight += weight
    return distance / total_weight
```

**Key statistics compared with weights:**
- `y_diversity`: Y-chromosome diversity (weight = 2.0)
- `mt_diversity`: mtDNA diversity (weight = 2.0)
- `prop_father_son`: Father-son relationship ratio (weight = 1.5)
- `prop_mother_daughter`: Mother-daughter relationship ratio (weight = 1.5)
- `sex_ratio`: Male/female burial ratio (weight = 1.0)
- `prop_y_matches`: Y-chromosome sharing in kinship pairs (weight = 1.0)
- `prop_mt_matches`: mtDNA sharing in kinship pairs (weight = 1.0)

### Rejection Step

```python
# Step 3: Accept only the closest simulations
epsilon = np.quantile(distances, 0.05)  # Accept top 5% of simulations
accepted_mask = distances <= epsilon
accepted_systems = systems[accepted_mask]
```

**In our analysis:**
- **500 total simulations** per site (100 per inheritance system)
- **25 simulations accepted** (5% acceptance rate)
- **ε (epsilon) threshold** = 5th percentile of distances

### Posterior Probability Calculation

```python
# Step 4: Calculate posterior probabilities from accepted simulations
for system in unique_systems:
    # Count how many accepted simulations came from each system
    count = np.sum(accepted_systems == system)
    # Posterior = proportion of accepted simulations from this system
    posteriors[system] = count / len(accepted_systems)
```

### Example: Duxford Site Analysis

#### Input Data:
- **500 simulations total** (100 per system)
- **25 accepted** (ε = 0.2005)

#### Accepted Simulations by System:
```
strongly_patrilineal:  9 accepted / 25 total = 0.36 posterior (36%)
weakly_patrilineal:    7 accepted / 25 total = 0.28 posterior (28%)
balanced:              2 accepted / 25 total = 0.08 posterior (8%)
weakly_matrilineal:    2 accepted / 25 total = 0.08 posterior (8%)
strongly_matrilineal:  5 accepted / 25 total = 0.20 posterior (20%)
```

#### Bayes Factors:
```python
prior_prob = 1.0 / 5 = 0.20  # Uniform prior over 5 systems
bayes_factors = {
    'strongly_patrilineal': 0.36 / 0.20 = 1.80,
    'weakly_patrilineal': 0.28 / 0.20 = 1.40,
    'balanced': 0.08 / 0.20 = 0.40,
    'weakly_matrilineal': 0.08 / 0.20 = 0.40,
    'strongly_matrilineal': 0.20 / 0.20 = 1.00
}
```

### Interpretation

The **posterior probability** represents: *"Given the observed archaeological data, what is the probability that this inheritance system generated the patterns we see?"*

For Duxford:
- **36% chance** the site follows strongly patrilineal inheritance
- **28% chance** weakly patrilineal
- **20% chance** strongly matrilineal
- **8% chance each** for balanced or weakly matrilineal

### Why ABC Rejection Sampling?

#### Advantages:
1. **Model-free**: No need to specify complex likelihood functions
2. **Flexible**: Can incorporate any summary statistics
3. **Realistic**: Uses full simulation model with all complexities
4. **Interpretable**: Direct comparison of simulation outputs to data

#### Challenges:
1. **Computational cost**: Requires many simulations
2. **Curse of dimensionality**: Performance degrades with many statistics
3. **Choice of summary statistics**: Must capture relevant patterns
4. **Acceptance rate**: Too strict = few samples, too loose = poor approximation

2. **Site-Specific Patterns**: Different sites show distinct inheritance signatures, suggesting local variation in social organization

3. **Methodological Insights**:
   - Small sample sizes limit statistical power
   - Burial bias and aDNA preservation affect results
   - Migration and intermarriage complicate pure inheritance patterns

4. **Archaeological Implications**:
   - Roman period may represent transitional social organization
   - Local communities maintained distinct kinship practices
   - Continental European influence mixed with indigenous British patterns

2. **Spatial Analysis**: Regional inheritance pattern modeling
3. **Environmental Factors**: Climate and resource effects on social organization
4. **Integration**: Combine with isotope, artifact, and burial data

## Conclusion

This agent-based model provides a rigorous computational framework for testing inheritance hypotheses against archaeological aDNA data. The results reveal a complex landscape of inheritance patterns in Roman-era Cambridgeshire, with evidence for both patrilineal and matrilineal systems operating at different sites.

The methodology demonstrates the power of combining:
- Agent-based modeling for realistic population dynamics
- Approximate Bayesian Computation for statistical inference
- Archaeological genetics for empirical validation

This approach can be extended to other archaeological contexts and time periods, providing a quantitative foundation for understanding past social organization through genetic evidence.
